// Given an array of strings words and a character separator, split each string in words by separator.

// Return an array of strings containing the new strings formed after the splits, excluding empty strings.

// Notes

// separator is used to determine where the split should occur, but it is not included as part of the resulting strings.
// A split may result in more than two strings.
// The resulting strings must maintain the same order as they were initially given.

// Example 1:

// Input: words = ["one.two.three","four.five","six"], separator = "."
// Output: ["one","two","three","four","five","six"]
// Explanation: In this example we split as follows:

// "one.two.three" splits into "one", "two", "three"
// "four.five" splits into "four", "five"
// "six" splits into "six"

// Hence, the resulting array is ["one","two","three","four","five","six"].
